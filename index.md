## Diabetic Food Guide App Support

* This is a simple Food Guide app for children with Diabetes.

* Children with Type 1 Diabetes need insulin injections to control blood sugar level. The dose of insulin is decided based on the amount of carbohydrate in each individualâ€™s diet.
* It is important for the children to understand the amount of carbohydrate in the common food items they consume. This information was published in 2015 and now I am happy to give it in this format as children have this as a quick reference.
* In the modern fast moving world it would be handy to have these references on their fingertips through mobile devices instead of referring to books. The accurate details that will be obtained via a single touch on the app would make their life easier to achieve a better blood sugar control.

**Disclaimer: Use this App with the help of a Paediatric endocrinologist who is specialized to treat children with diabetes.**
